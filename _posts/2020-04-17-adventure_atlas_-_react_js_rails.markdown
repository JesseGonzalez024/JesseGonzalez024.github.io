Greetings and Salutations, 

I am towards the end of my journey with Flatiron. Its been a ride. All those sleepless nights and long days of struggle have led me to here- my final Portfolio Project.

This blog post is in regards to my React-Redux + Rails API project, where I have used all I've learned for the past 5 months.

My final vision for the project is far from over, but the base is well founded. Prior to this final step, my knowledge with React and Redux was less than welcoming. But this project has help me embrace the curiosity that comes with programming and trying different things until getting the desired result.

I work towards the imporvement of my project, and to provide updates in the near by future. This Bblog post will also be updated soon. Stay tuned
