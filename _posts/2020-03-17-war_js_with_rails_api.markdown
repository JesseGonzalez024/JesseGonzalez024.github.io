Greetings & Salutations,

Jesse here, writing about recent completion of my Project Portfolio JavaScript project. Short blog here, further updates will come with more details and perfected overall project.

JavaScript shares plenty of similar syntax alongside Ruby which we had been previously learning about. This made coding JS fairly inviting. Even class syntax is pretty comparable and therefor feels familiar. With JavaScript however, it often feels like not much is ever being completed due to the language requiring plenty lines of code in exchange for limited visible output. But the idea of APIs was so fascinating to learn. 

The overall Full- Stack is slowly taking form, and the world of coding is unwrapping itself before my eyes. Every day Iâ€™m realizing how much there is to learn. This is a field wherever no one will ever truly know it all, and I for one welcome such pursuits
