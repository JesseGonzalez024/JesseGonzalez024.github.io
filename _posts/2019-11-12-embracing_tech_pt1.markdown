 I'm actually really bad with computers. Usually it's very easy to tell.

So why coding? 
Why would someone who acknowledges their lack of computer savvy be interested in a field where technology is in abundance and in high demand? 

 After graduating high school I dove right into the workforce. I like to think I had an above average job for someone my age and lack of experience. I continued to evolve in the financial field. But eventually, the longer I stayed, the more I realized how much of my soul and person was being drained. Truly, I hated working at a bank. Nothing against them, simply wasn't who I wanted to be. 

Eventually in this spinning vortex of daydreams, daydreaming about an alternate reality where I did not dread waking up and feeling like an empty shell for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Eventually I started to carve out what I wanted in a job. What I needed that job to provide me with, both emotionally and physically. My thought process was that if I was going to work for the majority of my life, it be best to not hate every minute of it.

All that daydreaming led me to an ideal version of self and lifestyle :

1. Location independent
2. Flexibility to travel to heart's content 
3. A never ending learning environment
4. Some kind of creativity and cognizant duties
5. Well paid

Enter software development:

With those key aspects in mind, I was able to filter through the endless other unwanted opportunities. I did plenty of research on the Digital Nomad lifestyle and career choices, for that was and continues to be my overall objective when it comes to lifestyle.  My research concluded that a career in Software Development gave me the highest chance of satisfying all my requirements.

Yet I had my doubts. Serious ones. Doubt in self mostly.

Luckily a good friend of mine, had already gone through the hurdles and was employed as a developer. His advice and coaching was and forever will be appreciated. Also the way he described programming, the way he made the computer terminal feel like a the gateway to creating a universe where you're essentially the warden of reality, forever inducing laws and structure to create a functioning realm, peaked my interest. Not to sound like a control freak, but to possess the ability of creating a reality of your choosing, seemed to involve the levels of creativity and ingenuity that I was looking for. Most Importantly this good friend assured me that after every difficult battle, even greater rewards would await. 

After talking to a trusted source and listening carefully, their undeniable passion for the field, moved me to give it an honest shot. 

I've only been on this journey for the past two months. There is still a universe worth of information ahead of me. I've already had more late nights starring at my terminal than I'd like to publicly admit. Yet, despite all these uphill battles and fights against my own nature, I can't help but feel that an abnormal yet thrilling amount of excitement fills me every morning as I wake up, knowing that I'll be learning something new. Iâ€™ve learned to embrace technology.
