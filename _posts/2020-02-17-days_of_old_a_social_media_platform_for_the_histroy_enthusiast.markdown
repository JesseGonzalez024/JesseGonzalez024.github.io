Greetings & Salutations! Thank you for taking the time to read this post. My name is Jesse Gonzalez and I am an up and coming Software Developer at the amazing Flatiron School.

My journey thus far has led me to Ruby on Rails- an excellent, easy to use Framework for your web programming needs. 

My relationship with Rails started off on the wrong foot. Having just have worked on Sinatra frameworks only 2 weeks prior, I was beginning to miss Sinatra’s explicit web building mapping orientation. With Sinatra so much happens behind the scenes, but so much of it also happens with the programmer building one line of code at a time. That being said, yes, it can be extremely tedious, but also encouraging to see and be able to explicitly map all your routes.

With Rails, it’s different. Rail’s is big, really big. It sill amazes me how self aware, or in programming terms; “DYNAMIC” this vast tool is. So much happens behind the scene and at first it was difficult keeping track of its all, not to mention the at first overwhelming number of files.

But after a couple sessions on Rails, everything started to click. All the behind the scenes features like the built in route helper methods and form methods were the epitome  of time saving. Previously in Sinatra, writing HTML tags, albeit fun, was incredibly tedious due to how most tags require an closing tag and often they can be hard to keep track of without proper local environment extensions, especially as your HTML begins taking countless curves.

True, Rails can be intimidating at first. But after a couple tries, you realized Rails is not meant to be a monster but an ally in the Web Programming. It was created with the developer in mind.

I intend to update this blog post as my Rails Project takes a deeper approach with more visually appealing interface.

That being said, my Rails Project is far from complete. More features will be posted and with the upcoming course in JavaScript I hope to utilize this new tool to make the overall experience more pleasurable. My project is meant to simulate a social media platform but with historic events as the theme given my love for anything of past ages. Golden Age Thinking after all.

Until next time, cheers & happy coding!
