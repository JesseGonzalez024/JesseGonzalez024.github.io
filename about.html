<p>Greetings! My name is Jesse and I am an aspiring software developer. Officially my journey began at FlatIron School, as I embrace the coding bootcamp culture. Despite the nerve-racking decision and the many doubts that occupy my mind, this journey grows more exciting with each passing day. The bigger the challenge, the larger the reward.</p>
